# C# Directory
============================</br>

This is the beginning of what I'm guessing will be a pretty large repo. Just creating some basic stuff right now, but will be expanding into ASP.NET and .NET desktop type work.

## CalculatorCS Repo
============================</br>
- This is one of the first *major* projects I've done in C#. 
- As such, I ran into a few problems. Nothing major, just simple debugging issues. Things like: 
- * Missing a semicolon
- * Misspelling a variable or variable declaration.
- Pretty simple things in my opinion. Also pretty easy to catch. 
- I plan on expanding on this app every once and awhile. As I learn more and more about C#.

## ASP.NET Repo
============================</br>
- This is my first ASP.NET project. I'm currently working on a repo within ASP.NET called JokesWebApp. 
- In Jokes Web App, I'm working on creating a way to login to the site as well as adding the actual joke functionality to the site as well. 
- ASP.NET is pretty new to me, I've been coding in primarily JavaScript in my career so far. But it has been really fun stretching outside of my comfort zone a little bit.

## WorkoutCS Repo
============================</br>
- This application is an application I built in a little less than an hour.
- I am working on bringing newer functionality to the application. 
- Things like: 
- * Adding your own workouts.
- * Adding classes and objects within the app to simplify things.
- * Adding different workouts to corresponding body areas.
- Stuff like that will really bulk up the program and show my expertise I believe. 

## Unadded Repo
============================</br>
- This repo will be a states repo, it will basically function just like my states.rb application found in my Ruby Repo. However this will be coded in C#. 
- More to come about this repo at a later time. :)
